1,SQL Injection,""" or 1=1 --",Login form that checks username and password. The application directly concatenates user input into SQL queries without proper validation.,This payload was passed into a product search query. Identify the likely intention.,This payload attempts to bypass authentication by always making the WHERE clause evaluate as true.,"The comment (--) removes the password check, and OR '1'='1' makes the condition always true. Try using OR operators with always-true conditions.",Beginner,10
2,SQL Injection,; DROP TABLE users; --,A search field where input is directly concatenated into SQL queries.,What would this payload attempt to do if successful?,"This payload attempts to execute multiple SQL statements, with the second one trying to delete the users table completely.","Look for the semicolon (;) which separates SQL statements. The second command after the semicolon attempts to delete data. This is called statement stacking.",Intermediate,20
3,SQL Injection,"' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --",Product search function that displays results from a database query.,How does this attack attempt to extract sensitive information?,"The UNION keyword combines the results of two SELECT statements, allowing an attacker to access data from other tables.","UNION allows combining results from multiple SELECT queries. First, determine the number of columns, then use UNION SELECT to retrieve data from other tables like 'users'.",Advanced,30
4,SQL Injection,admin' AND SLEEP(5) --,A login page that returns generic error messages but has different response times.,What type of SQL injection relies on response time delays?,Time-based Blind SQL Injection uses time delays to infer database information.,"Use database time functions like SLEEP() or WAITFOR DELAY to cause deliberate delays. If the response is delayed, your injection worked. Measure response times to extract data bit by bit.",Advanced,35
5,SQL Injection,"admin' AND SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a' --",A system that only returns true/false responses without data.,How can you extract data when you only get yes/no responses?,Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection extracts data by asking true/false questions.,"Use SUBSTRING() or MID() to extract one character at a time from sensitive fields. Test each character (a-z, 0-9) and observe true/false responses. Automate this with tools like sqlmap.",Expert,40
6,SQL Injection,' ORDER BY 5 --,An e-commerce site search function that displays product names.,How can you determine the number of columns in a SELECT query?,This payload uses ORDER BY to determine column count by incrementing the number until an error occurs.,"Start with ORDER BY 1, then 2, 3, etc. Keep incrementing until you get an error. The last successful number tells you how many columns the query returns.",Intermediate,25
7,SQL Injection,"' UNION SELECT NULL,@@version,NULL --",A news portal that displays articles based on category ID.,How can you extract database version information?,This payload extracts the database version using @@version function via UNION injection.,"Use database-specific functions: @@version (MySQL/MSSQL), version() (PostgreSQL), or banner from v$version (Oracle). Combine with UNION SELECT after finding column count.",Advanced,35
8,SQL Injection,' AND 1=CONVERT(int,(SELECT TOP 1 username FROM users)) --,A corporate intranet with user profiles.,How can you extract data from error messages?,Error-based SQL injection extracts data by forcing type conversion errors that reveal information.,"Force type conversion errors using CONVERT() or CAST(). The database will include the actual data in the error message when conversion fails. Works well when UNION is blocked.",Expert,45
9,SQL Injection,admin'/**/OR/**/'1'='1'/**/--,A secure login form with WAF (Web Application Firewall).,How can you bypass WAF filters using encoding?,This payload uses inline comments to obfuscate SQL keywords and bypass WAF filters.,"Use inline comments (/**/) to break up keywords that WAFs detect. Also try: URL encoding (%27), double encoding, case variation (SeLeCt), or hex encoding to evade filters.",Expert,50
10,SQL Injection,"'; EXEC xp_cmdshell('whoami'); --",A database backup tool with restricted access.,How can you achieve Remote Code Execution through SQL?,This payload uses xp_cmdshell to execute OS commands through SQL injection achieving RCE.,"In MSSQL, use xp_cmdshell to run OS commands. In MySQL, try INTO OUTFILE to write files. PostgreSQL has COPY TO PROGRAM. These features must be enabled by the DBA.",Expert,60
